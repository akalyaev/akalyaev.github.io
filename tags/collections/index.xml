      <description>I am in constant search of useful information and considering podcasts as one of the sources. Please note the word useful. I do not listen to podcasts where the hosts tell the story of how they hang out yesterday in the pub! And you could be surprised of how many of such podcasts are out there. A huge number! Otherwise, podcasts are very convenient. You can listen to them while on the go or standing in the line at the local store.</description>
